# VBA_Challenge
## Overveiw
For this project my goal was to take a list of Stock tickers and the trading data associated with them and write code that would output info on them. This data can then be presnted quickly and cleanly and be used to make more informed decisions for future stock trading.

## Results
Between 2017 was a good year to invest. Every stock but TERP, and some went up as much as 199%! Comapre this to 2018 which had all stock but two go up ENPH and RUN respectively. The code i refactored had a slower run time then the orignal code. the orginal code had a .76 run time where as the new code had a .97 second run time
