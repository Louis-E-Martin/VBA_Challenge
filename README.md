# VBA_Challenge
## Overveiw
For this project my goal was to take a list of Stock tickers and the trading data associated with them and write code that would output info on them. This data can then be presnted quickly and cleanly and be used to make more informed decisions for future stock trading.

## Results
Between 2017 was a good year to invest. Every stock but TERP, and some went up as much as 199%! Comapre this to 2018 which had all stock but two go up ENPH and RUN respectively. The code I refactored had a slower run time then the orignal code. the orginal code had a .76 run time where as the new code had a .97 second run time

## Summary
There are a few advantages to refactoring code. First you can optimize your code to use less memory or run faster. Second you could possibly make your code neater and more orginized so that it is easier to read in the future. Lastly you could pottential increase the codes functionality so that it could be run on more data or give more detailed feed back. Some downsides of refactoring code is first it takes more time. Somethimes working is good enough and it might not be worth the time to go back and make it sligtly better. You could also potentially break any code that may run of the code you are refactoring making it a bigger task to change it then you orgianlly thought. For our code I would say that the advatage of our refactoring is that it is much more modifiable then the old code and at any point you could change just a few varibles and get it to run on a bigger sheet. The disadvatage of our refactored code is it takes a little longer to run. One last advantge to our new code is that i think it is a little easier to read and understand compared to our old code.
